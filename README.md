# Lego-SQL
Small database/sql project to get to know SQL

I use a fictional Lego store that manages its stock of Lego sets. In the finished system the database system will adjust the reserved number of sets when a new order comes in and adjust the stock size and amount of reserved sets when an order completes.
It will also order new Lego sets from a supplier if their count is to low. Once an order is completed (i.e. the supplier delivered) the stock size of said Lego set will be adjusted by the database system.
